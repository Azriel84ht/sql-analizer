# sql-analizer
This repository is for a simple app to analyze a complex query from SQL.
Things to know:
- This is my first Java Application
- I've started this, to make me some job tasks easier
- This app obtains the objects from where are obtained all data and objects in where are inserted (or updated)
- I've started testing this software with an Stored Procedure from Teradata database (I've not uploaded one because they come from my job)
